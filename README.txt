Hello, this is a choose-your-own-adventure style game made 
by Cody Phillips. To play, simply follow on screen 
advice and answer with one of the letters/numbers given.
Sometimes you can answer with words if asked or by secret.
When this happens use words like use, grab, climb, hit etc.
(with underscore for spaces)and you might uncover something. 
Have fun with the story!
